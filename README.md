# Time Series Forecasting Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building, training, and evaluating Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time series forecasting tasks. The project demonstrates how to preprocess time series data, build a basic RNN model using TensorFlow/Keras, and evaluate the model's performance.

## Introduction

Time series forecasting is a critical task in various domains, including finance, weather prediction, and inventory management. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are well-suited for sequential data like time series, as they can capture temporal dependencies.

This project showcases the use of RNNs for forecasting future values of a time series based on historical data. The notebook provided in this repository walks through the entire process, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RNN_TimeSeries_Forecasting.git
   cd RNN_TimeSeries_Forecasting
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model building, and evaluation.
- **models/**: Saved models after training.
- **results/**: Stores the evaluation metrics and plots generated during the model evaluation.

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing

Before training the model, the time series data needs to be preprocessed. This involves:

1. **Loading the data**: The dataset should be placed in the `data/` directory.
2. **Normalizing the data**: This helps in speeding up the training process and achieving better performance.
3. **Splitting the data**: Dividing the data into training and test sets.

### Model Training

The `RNN_project.ipynb` notebook contains the code to build, compile, and train the RNN model. The model architecture includes:

- An input layer for feeding time series data.
- A recurrent layer (SimpleRNN, LSTM, or GRU).
- Dense layers for output.

To train the model, simply run the cells in the notebook. The model will be saved in the `models/` directory upon completion.

### Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on the test set to measure its performance. The evaluation metrics include:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Plots of the predicted vs. actual values are generated to visualize the model's performance.

## Results

The results from the model's evaluation are saved in the `results/` directory. This includes evaluation metrics and visualizations of the model's predictions.
